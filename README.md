# BlueCity Biodiversity: Human Mobility and Habitat Fragmentation 

This repository contains tools and notebooks for analyzing the relationship between mobility infrastructure 
and biodiversity. 
It focuses on generating and analyzing *Circular Sampling Zones* around human mobility axis (such as roads and rail) to
measure relationship between the features of the mobility infrastructure and the biodiversity (natural habitats) in the surrounding areas.

--- 
##  Project Overview

The project is composed of three main Jupyter Notebooks:

1. **Sampling Zone Generation:** Generates *Circular Sampling Zones* (`buffers`) along roads or rails and adds the spatial data of habitats from [Swisstopo Habitat Map](https://opendata.swiss/en/dataset/lebensraumkarte-der-schweiz).
2. **Data Analysis:** Performs statistical and spatial analysis on the generated dataset.
3. **Visualization and Insights:** Derives insights and visual representations from the processed data.

These notebooks work together to support research on how urban structures may influence biodiversity, using geospatial data and custom preprocessing logic.
